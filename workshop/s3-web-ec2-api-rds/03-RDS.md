# RDS

## Create a PostgreSQL instance in RDS
1. Go to **RDS** under **Database** section.
2. Click on Get Started Now.
3. Click on PostgreSQL logo and then click select.
4. Check the option of Dev/Test section and click Next Step.
5. On **DB Instance class** select : `db.t2.micro`. We are not going to need much more for this workshop.
6. On **Multi-AZ Deployment** select: no.
7. Enter a name on DB Instance identifier (we will need it later, so donâ€™t forget it).
8. Enter a username and password and click Next (again, we will need these later).
9. Select No on **Publicly Accessible**.
10. Availability Zone: `us-east-1a`.
11. Pick a db name and click Launch Instance (again, we will need the database name later).
12. Click View Your DB Instances.

Now our instance is created. We will configure its access, allowing every instance under the security group that was created in the previous section.

1. Click on the name of the **Security Groups** under **Configuration Details** of your RDS instance
2. Go to Inbound and click edit
3. On source you have to put the group-id that you copied on the last step when [creating an EC2 instance](/workshop/s3-web-ec2-api-rds/02-EC2-instances.md).

Now, only your instance will have access to the database, and nobody else.

## Add DB parameters on Parameters Store

As before, we will need some variables stored in the parameter store, including the database name, username, password and endpoint. These variables are referenced in [this file](/backend/conduit/settings/ec2.py), so Django can access the database.

1. Go to **RDS** under **Database** section.
2. Click on Instances.
3. See details of your db and copy the url of the **Endpoint** (until the `:` ). This will be the value for `DATABASE_HOST`.
4. Go to **EC2** under **Compute** section.
5. On the left menu select Parameter Store.
6. Click Create Parameter.
7. Enter  `/prod/api/DATABASE_NAME` as the name and a meaningful description like "Name of the PostgreSQL database".
8. Enter the DB name (which was selected on step 10 of the previous section) on the value attribute.
9. Click create parameter and close.
10. Now we will need to do the same thing for the username and host
  1. For the username enter `/prod/api/DATABASE_USER` as the name and your database username and as the value
  2. For the host enter `/prod/api/DATABASE_HOST` as the name and the hostname you copied earlier as the value
11. For `/prod/api/DATABASE_PASSWORD` do the same steps but select as **Type: Secure String** and as KMS Key ID the key `workshopkey`.

Now we have our database parameters set, and the password encrypted. Only our EC2 instances will be able to decrypt it.

**Next:** create a [CodeDeploy project to deploy your API](/workshop/s3-web-ec2-api-rds/04-code-deploy.md).
