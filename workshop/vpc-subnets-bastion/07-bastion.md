# Bastion

Now we are going to add a Bastion so we can access thru S3 to our private instances.
A Bastion is basically a instance located in one of our public subnets, will be able to ssh provate instances because, private instances allow all traffic from the inside of our VPC.

Next: [Finishing our deploy with VPC, junt need to modify our CodeDeploy project and re-build](/workshop/vpc-subnets-bastion/08-finishing-up.md)
